**Hi there ðŸ‘‹**

My name is **Harry**, and I am passionately pursuing studies in both Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. I'm fascinated by the intersection of robust software systems and intelligent algorithms.

``Here's a little more about me:``

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my personal portfolio website using React and Node.js, and a machine learning model to predict stock trends.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python for Data Science, Deep Learning fundamentals with TensorFlow, and modern JavaScript frameworks.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to AI, especially in NLP or Computer Vision.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding the intricacies of deploying machine learning models to production (MLOps).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Tech, the latest trends in AI, coding best practices, or my current learning path! I love a good discussion.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: The feeling of seeing my first full-stack application run without errors is what hooked me on programming for good.
